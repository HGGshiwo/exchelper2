Part II Reading Comprehension
Section A
Directions: There are 2 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.
 
Passage One
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:
We like to think of ourselves as rational creatures. We watch our backs, weigh the odds, pack an umbrella. But both neuroscience and social science suggest that we are more optimistic than realistic. On average, we expect things to turn out better than they wind up being. People hugely underestimate their chances of getting divorced, losing their job or being diagnosed with cancer; expect their children to be extraordinarily gifted; and overestimate their likely life span.
The belief that the future will be much better than the past and present is known as the optimism bias. It abides in every race, region and socioeconomic bracket. Schoolchildren playing when-I-grow-up are rampant optimists, but so are grownups: a 2005 study found that adults over 60 are just as likely to see the glass half full as young adults.
You might expect optimism to erode under the tide of news about violent conflicts, high unemployment, tornadoes and floods and all the threats and failures that shape human life. Collectively we can grow pessimistic—about the direction of our country or the ability of our leaders to improve education and reduce crime. But private optimism, about our personal future, remains incredibly resilient. A survey conducted in 2007 found that while 70% thought families in general were less successful than in their parents’ day, 76% of the respondents were optimistic about the future of their own family.
Overly positive assumptions can lead to disastrous miscalculations—make us less likely to get health checkups, apply sunscreen or open a savings account, and more likely to bet the farm on a bad investment. But the bias also protects and inspires us: it keeps us moving forward rather than to the nearest high-rise cliff. Without optimism, our ancestors might never have ventured far from their tribes and we might all be cave dwellers, still huddled together and dreaming of light and heat.
To make progress, we need to be able to imagine alternative realities—better ones—and we need to believe that we can achieve them. Such faith helps motivate us to pursue our goals. Optimists in general work longer hours and tend to earn more. Although they are not less likely to divorce, they are more likely to remarry—an act that is, as Samuel Johnson wrote, the triumph of hope over experience.
31. The author uses the example of “pack an umbrella” to illustrate that people are ________.
A) excessively cautious                               B) generally sensible
C) extremely pessimistic                              D) quite adaptable
32. According to the passage, which of the following is true of the optimism bias?
  A) Adults are not so optimistic about life as children.
  B) One’s social status will affect his optimism bias profoundly.
  C) It’s a sign of optimism when children say “when I grow up”.
  D) Old people and young adults are equally pessimistic about life.
33. The word “resilient” in Paragraph 3 is closest in meaning to “________”.
  A) able to recover quickly                                   B) dominant
  C) showing signs of decline                         D) invariable
34. Paragraph 4 is intended to emphasize ________.
  A) the endless pursuit of hope
  B) the real asset of optimism
  C) the invaluable contributions of our forefathers
  D) the detrimental effect of positive assumptions
35. Which of the following falls into the category of the optimism bias?
  A) Exercising prudence in the presence of threats.
  B) Working longer hours and earning more money.
  C) Turning out better than expected.
  D) Picturing a better optional reality.
 
Passage Two
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:
A few weeks ago, several friends and I braved the approaching rainstorm and went to the National Book Festival on the Washington Mall. The purpose of attending was to hear David McCullough speak. As one of the nation’s most prolific (多产的) writers, David McCullough has written numerous biographies including John Adams and Henry Truman.
Yet, after arriving at the crowded venue, and expecting to hear a scholarly lecture on his latest book, I was surprised to hear him speak about the condition of U.S. public schools, and in particular how students lack a basic understanding of American history. Incidentally, the reason people were often thrilled to read his books, he said, was because they had never learned about these important subjects in school.
After investigating what I imagined to be an exaggerated contention, I was really shocked by what I discovered:
Apparently U.S. students are unfamiliar with the famous paraphrased aphorism (格言), “Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” That’s because a new report shows that students anywhere from high school to fourth grade are solely lacking in their knowledge of American history.
This fact, of course, should concern parents, teachers and local communities across the country. But, at the end of the day, shouldn’t every American care?
We study our own history, at least in part, to commemorate and remember all of those who gave their lives to preserve the liberties and freedoms we cherish as Americans. To forget the determination of the soldiers at Normandy, or the courage of the passengers aboard Flight 93 would be an affront to their legacy and reflect the narcissism(自恋) and ingratitude of our own people.
Furthermore, by reducing the importance of U.S. history in public schools, we deprive American children of an opportunity to learn about their heritage. And in so doing, we fail these students by neglecting to adequately educate them. The study of history–and particularly American history–cultivates an understanding and appreciation for the ideals the nation was founded upon. Thomas Jefferson, for example, believed deeply that an educated citizenry was essential to the preservation of the American experiment. After all, how can one expect our descendants to preserve American democratic principles if they cannot define what they are?
36. The author went to the National Book Festival in order to ________.
A) hear David McCullough’s lecture on his latest book
B) hear David McCullough talk about his many biographies
C) attend a scholarly lecture on the teaching of history
D) attend a symposium on the condition of public schools
37. Why did some of the readers find McCullough’s books exciting?
A) Because they lacked an understanding of American history.
B) Because they liked his exaggerating style of writing.
C) Because his books were easily understandable.
D) Because he wrote about many American presidents.
38. The word“affront”(Para. 6) is closest in meaning to “________”.
A) celebration                 B) criticism                  C) preservation             D) offense
39. According to the author, why is the study of American history so important?
A) Because it drives Americans into even bolder experiments.
B) Because it helps Americans maintain their religious identity.
C) Because the preservation of democracy depends on it.
D) Because the appreciation of the American dream stems from it.
